When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are collaborating with other people on a project.
    When you work from more than one computer on a solo project.
    Also a good idea to have a remote repository to act as a backup if you
    are working on a solo project from just one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have changes on your local repository that have yet to be pushed
    to the remote and if someone else has pushed changes to a version of
    the file you are working on to the remote then automatically pulling it
    would overwrite the file you were working on on your local repository
    and you would lose your changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are where you use git hub to clone another repository to your git hub account on git hub itself.
    Cloning is when you copy a branch of a repository from git hub to your local machine or from 
    one repository to another on you local machine.
    Branches are part a series of commits that can be traced back in terms of parental succession to
    their common origin.  Branches enable you develop brach off from a common point to explore developing 
    new features and test them without worrying that anotherr developers changes might impact on yours

    You would use a fork to make a copy of someone elses project in your own git hub repository.
    You would clone a repository when you wanted to work on it on a loca machine
    You would create a branch of a project when you wanted to try out a new feature
