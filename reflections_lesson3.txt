When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are collaborating with other people on a project.
    When you work from more than one computer on a solo project.
    Also a good idea to have a remote repository to act as a backup if you
    are working on a solo project from just one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have changes on your local repository that have yet to be pushed
    to the remote and if someone else has pushed changes to a version of
    the file you are working on to the remote then automatically pulling it
    would overwrite the file you were working on on your local repository
    and you would lose your changes.
